A very basic fanfiction.net scraper to create an API that can be worked with. There's still some hiccups - it can't get the author name of stories with multiple characters in the get_fandoms_of_category function - and I started on this project with little knowledge and gathering what I needed along the way. As I get to know the language better, the project could be written a lot better.
Should save stuff in a db too for better use and to lessen the load on the website.

Examples:

/categories

/book/fandoms

/book/Harry Potter/stories/1

/story/11446957/chapter/1

/story/11384558/metadata

/story/9801437/chapter_titles
